Decision Title: Development of New Mobile App for Retail Company
Context: Creating a mobile app for a retail company that will serve as a platform for customers to browse and purchase products, manage their orders, track deliveries, and participate in a loyalty program.
Options Considered
•       Target only iOS devices (iPhone and iPad).
•       Target only Android devices (phones and tablets).
•       Develop for both iOS and Android Devices.
Decision
The decision is made to develop for both iOS and Android devices.
1.      Native App: The decision is to build a native mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. Native development will offer the best performance and user experience. This decision ensures the app performs well and integrates seamlessly with features unique to iOS and Android.
2.      UI Framework: For the native app development, we will use platform-specific UI frameworks: SwiftUI for iOS and Jetpack Compose for Android. These tools help us create modern and efficient user interfaces that match the design standards of each platform.
3.      Backend Language: We will utilize Node.js for the backend development. Node.js is good for handling many user requests at once, ensuring the application responds quickly and handles real-time interactions smoothly.
4.      Permissions: The app will request necessary permissions from users based on the functionalities they access. For example, if the app has augmented reality features, it will need permission to use the camera. This helps protect user privacy and ensures the app only uses the features it needs.
5.      Data Storage: The app will feature a combination of local storage and server-side databases.
6.      Push Notification Service: We'll use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications to users' devices. This ensures notifications are delivered reliably and can be customized to reach specific groups of users.
7.      Payment Gateways: We'll integrate Stripe into the app to handle payments securely. Stripe has developer-friendly APIs, and a wide range of supported payment methods and currencies.
8.      Analytics Tool: Google Analytics will be used for tracking how users interact with the app. Google Analytics offers comprehensive insights and metrics that will help us understand user interactions and improve the app's performance and user experience.
9.      Image Storage and Optimization: We will use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storing product images due to its scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. To optimize image loading and performance, we will implement caching, lazy loading, and compression techniques within the app.
10.     Localization Framework: We'll use the built-in tools provided by iOS and Android to translate the app into different languages and adapt it to different cultural preferences. This ensures the app is accessible and user-friendly for people all around the world.
Consequences
•       By opting for native app development, we ensure optimal performance and seamless integration with platform-specific features.
•       Utilizing Node.js for the backend enables efficient handling of concurrent requests and real-time interactions.
•       Integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging ensures reliable delivery of push notifications to users.
•       Stripe integration offers secure and convenient payment transactions for customers.
•       Google Analytics integration provides valuable insights into user behavior, aiding in app improvement and optimization.
•       Implementing Amazon S3 for image storage ensures scalability and optimal performance for displaying product images.
•       Leveraging platform-specific localization features simplifies the process of adapting the app to different languages and cultural preferences.
